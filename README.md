# AIY-midi-syth

I'm writing this to use my existing Google AIY voice kit hardware to make a midi syth that can link an instrument to a a soundfont via FluidSynth. The goal is to use the button to create the midi link and turn on the button light when ink is established.


### Prerequisites

You will need the Google AIY voiice kit for a regular size Raspberry Pi and a 2 B+ or newer board (I used a 2 B+, this could possibly work on older hardware).

### Installing
